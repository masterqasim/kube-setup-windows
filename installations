With PowerShell, you must ensure Get-ExecutionPolicy is not Restricted. We suggest using Bypass to bypass the policy to get things installed or AllSigned for quite a bit more security.

Run Get-ExecutionPolicy. If it returns Restricted, then run Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned or Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process.

Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

Paste the copied text into your shell and press Enter.
Wait a few seconds for the command to complete.
If you don't see any errors, you are ready to use Chocolatey! Type choco or choco -? now, or see Getting Started for usage instructions




Scenario: Youâ€™re running grafana in kubernetes and need to update the admin password.

Easy one:

NAMESPACE=monitoring
POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods  -o=name -n "${NAMESPACE}" | grep grafana | cut -f2 -d\/
kubectl exec -it -n "${NAMESPACE}" "${POD_NAME}" -- /bin/sh -c "/usr/share/grafana/bin/grafana-cli admin reset-admin-password ${POD_NAME}"
Using the pod name as the password for the example.
